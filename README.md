# Infra Internship Code Challenge - 22nd May 2018
## Due: 23rd 9:00am May or Earlier


##### There are two tasks in this challenge, choose between the two. The submission instructions are specified at the bottom of the challenge page.

## Task 1
###### This program will be referred to as "logger"
Write a program that prints exactly 1000 lines of text to standard output. Each line of text is a date in the form dd/MM/YYYY, where: 
- valid ranges for days are 00-30
- valid ranges for months are 1-12
- valid ranges for years are 2017-2018
The lines of text are to be generated randomly - that is, there should be a reasonably arbitrary distribution of logs from all possible dates.


## Task 2
###### This program will be referred to as "viewer"
Write a program that reads lines of test from standard input. The program should process each line and:
-  Print "Malformed input" and exit, if the line is not in the form dd/MM/YYYY
-  Count lines from each month that appears in a line. The program should not count months that do not appear in any line.
-  Print lines from 0-14th of 2018.
Finally, the program should print each logged month with the percentage of lines of text from that month in the form:
   Month: XX%<br>
   Where "Month" refers to the name of that month.<br>
   For example:<br>
   May: 35%<br>

## Task 3
###### Launch the logger program and pipe its output to the viewer program.
